## Inductive Reasoning

Inductive Reasoning is the process of
drawing a general conclusion by
observing a pattern based on specific
instances. This conclusion is called a
*hypothesis* or *conjecture*. 

Example:

1. Ten is divisible by two.

Fourteen is divisible by two.
Conjecture: All even numbers are divisible by
two.

2. Covid-19 is deadly.

SARS is deadly.
MERS-COV is deadly.
Conjecture: Corona Viruses are deadly.

3. Quezon City is in Metro Manila.

Valenzuela City is in Metro Manila.
Conjecture: All cities are in Metro Manila. 

## Deductive Reasoning

Deductive Reasoning is the process of
using premises (accepted facts) and
logical principles to arrive at a specific
conclusion.

Example:

1. A number that is divisible by two is even.
Conclusion: 2020 is even.
2. Corona Viruses cause respiratory infections.
Covid-19 is a corona virus.
Conclusion: Covid-19 cause respiratory
infections.
3. Metro Manila is in the Philippines.
Quezon City is in Metro Manila.
Conclude: Quezon City is in the Philippines. 

## Problem Solving

Ancient mathematicians
such as Euclid and Pappus
were interested in solving
mathematical problems, but
they were also interested in
heuristics, the study of the
methods, and rules of
discovery and invention.


### George Polya
George Polya (1887 – 1985)
was born in Hungary and
moved to the United States in
1940. The basic problemsolving strategy that Polya
advocated consisted of the
following steps.
1. Understand the problem.
2. Devise a plan.
3. Carry out the plan.
4. Review the solution. 


### Solving Problems
There are many ways to solve a problem. The following are only a few ways to solve
some problems.
1. Make a list of the known information
2. Make a list of information that is needed
3. Draw a diagram
4. Make an organized list that shows all the possibilities
5. Make table or chart
6. Work backward
7. Try to solve a similar but simpler problem
8. Look for a pattern
9. Write an equation. If necessary, define what each variable represents
10. Perform an experiment
11. Guess at a solution and check the result

### Tips
* Work carefully
* Keep accurate and neat record
of all your attempts
* Realize that some of your existing plans will
not work and that you could devise another
plan or modify your existing plan.

### Review
* Ensure that the
solution is consistent
with the facts of the
problem.
* Interpret the solution
in the context of the
problem.
* Ask yourself whether
there are
generalizations of the
solution that could
apply to other
problems.

### Problem 1 (Working Backwards)
In consecutive turns of a Monopoly game,
Miya first paid Php. 800 for a hotel. She
then lost half her money when she landed
on Boardwalk. Next, she collected Php.
200 for passing GO. She then lost half her
remaining money when she landed on
Illinois Avenue. Miya now has Php. 2500.
How much did she have just before she
purchases the hotel?

### Solution 1 (Working Backwards)
The problem asks how much money Miya had originally before doing the following
transactions in order: paid Php. 800 for hotel -> lost half her money on a Boardwalk
-> collected Php. 200 on Go -> lost half the remaining money on Illinois -> has Php.
2500 left.
To work backwards, we will begin with the last event which is having Php. 2500 and
reverse the transactions done. In particular, the events in reverse order is depicted in
the table below. The first column lists the events in reverse order and the second
column computes the amount that Miya has before making the transaction for each
event.

| Event | Miya's Money|
|--|--|
|Miya's money now. |Php. 2500.00|
|Before Miya landed to Illinois Avenue.|Php. 2500 x 2 = Php. 5000.00|
|Before Miya passed to GO.|Php. 5000.00 – Php. 200.00 = Php. 4800.00|
|Before Miya landed to Boardwalk.|Php. 4800.00 x 2 = Php. 9,600.00|
|Before Miya purchase a hotel.|Php. 9,600.00 + Php. 800.00 = Php. 10, 400.00|

We now conclude that Miya has Php. 10, 400 at the start. You can check that this
answer is correct by making the transactions in order and ending up with Php. 2500. 

### Problem 2 (Looking for a Pattern)

1. Determine the units digit (ones’ digit) of the
counting number represented by the
exponential expression

a. 4^300

b. 2^725


### Solution 2 (Looking for a Pattern)
a. Try to find a pattern to solve this problem. We try to study the powers of 4.
The table below shows the first 6 powers of 4 and the corresponding units digit.


![Solution-2a](/assets/blog/3/Solution-2a.png)

Therefore, the units digit of 4^300 is 6.

b. The units digit of 2^725

We use the same strategy as in a. The table below shows the first 8 powers of 2
and the corresponding units digit. 

![Solution-2b](/assets/blog/3/Solution-2b.png)
Therefore, the unit digit 2^725 is 2.

### Problem 3 (Solving Problems by Drawing a Picture or a Diagram)

1. It cost Php. 50.00 to cut and weld a chain
link. Esmeralda has seven link and wishes to
make a chain. What is the minimum cost to do
this?

### Solution 3 (Solving Problems by Drawing a Picture or a Diagram)

Open link 2 and connect links 1, 2, and 3 

![Solution-3-1](/assets/blog/3/Solution-3-1.png)

Open link 5 and connect links 4, 5, and 6

![Solution-3-2](/assets/blog/3/Solution-3-2.png)

Since we only had to cut three links to make this chain, the cost will Php. 150.00 to
make the chain.
