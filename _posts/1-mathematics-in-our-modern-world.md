## What is Mathematics?
* Defined as study of numbers and arithmetic operations.
* Set of tools that can be applied to question of “how many” or “how much”.
* a study of pattern
* a language
* a process of thinking
* a set of problem solving tools
* an art

## Mathematics as a Study of Pattern
A pattern is an arrangement which helps observes
anticipate what they might see or what happens next. A
pattern also shows what may have come before. A pattern
organizes information so that it becomes more useful.

Patterns are studied because they are everywhere; people
just need to learn to notice them.

#### Various Types of Patterns

1. Logic Pattern

Logic patterns are usually the first to be
observed. Classifying things, for example, comes before
numeration. Being able to tell which things are blocks and
which are not precedes learning to count blocks. One kind of
logic pattern deals the characteristics of various objects
while another deals with order.

2. Number Patterns

Number patterns, such
as 2,4,6,8,10 are familiar to students
since they are among the first patterns
encountered in school. Mathematics is
especially useful when it helps predict
events.

3. Geometric Patterns

A geometric pattern is a motif or
design that depicts abstract shapes like lines,
polygons, and circles, and typically repeats like a
wallpaper. Visual patterns are observed in nature and
in art.

4. Word Pattern

erns can also be found in
language like the morphological rules on pluralizing
nouns or conjugating verbs for tense, as well as the
metrical rules of poetry. Each of these examples
supports mathematical and natural language
understanding. The focus here is pattern in form and
in syntax, which lead directly to the study language in
general and digital communication.


## Mathematics in Nature
Pattern indicate a sense of structure and organization
that it seem only humans are capable of producing
these intricate, creative, and amazing formations. It is
from this perspective that some people see an
“intelligent design” in the way that nature forms.

Recall that symmetry indicates that you can draw an
imaginary line across an object and resulting parts are
mirror images of each other.

## Order of Rotation
A figure has a rotational symmetry of order n (n-fold rotational symmetry) if 1/n of a complete turn leaves
the figure unchanged. to compute for the angle of rotation, use the formula

angle of rotation = 360 degrees / n

## Fibonacci Sequence

Fibonacci sequence is named after Italian mathematician
Leonardo of Pisa, who was better known by his nickname
Fibonacci. He is said to have discovered this sequence as he look a
hypothesized group of rabbits bred and reproduced.
Starting with 0 and 1, succeeding terms in the sequence can be
generated by adding the two numbers that came before the term.

It is also interesting to note that the ratios of successive Fibonacci
number approach the number Φ (Phi), also known as the Golden
Ratio. This is approximately equal to 1.618.
