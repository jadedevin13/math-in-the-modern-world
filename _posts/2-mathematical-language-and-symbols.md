##  Language
Language is “a systematic means of
communicating by the use of sound or
conventional symbols” (Chen, 2010, p. 353).
It is the code humans use as a form of
expressing themselves and communicating
with others. It may also be defined as a
system of words used in a particular
discipline.

### Language Components
These definitions describe language in
terms of the following components:
* a vocabulary of symbols or words
* a grammar consisting of rules on the
use of these symbols.
* a community of people who use and
understand these symbols.
* a range of meaning that can be
communicated with these symbols.  

Mathematics is a system of communication
about objects like numbers, variables, sets,
operations, functions, and equations. It is a
collection of both symbols and their
meaning shared by global community of
people who have an interest in the subject.
Regardless of where in the world learners of
math come from or what language they
speak, they will likely understand what those
symbol mean.

1. In order to be considered a language, a
system of communication must have
vocabulary, grammar, syntax, and people
who use and understand it.
2. Mathematics meets this definition of a
language. Linguists who don't consider
math a language cite its use as a written
rather than spoken form of
communication.
3. Math is a universal language. The symbols
and organization to form equations are
the same in every country of the world.

### Sentence
A sentence must contain a complete
thought. In English language an ordinary
sentence must contain a subject and a
predicate. 

### Expression
An expression is a name given to
mathematical object of interest.


## Characteristics of Mathematical Language
### Precise
It can make very fine distinction or definition
among a set of mathematical symbols.
### Concise
It can express otherwise long exposition or
sentences briefly using the language of
mathematics
### Powerful
One can express complex thought with
relative ease.
