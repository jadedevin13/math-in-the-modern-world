## Logic
Logic allows us to determine
the validity of arguments in and
out of mathematics. It highlights
the importance of precision and
conciseness of the language of
mathematics.


### Proposition
A Proposition is a declarative
sentence that can be classified
as true or false, but not both. 

### Paradox
A self-contradictory proposition
like this is called a paradox. 

### Simple proposition

a proposition that
conveys one thought with no connecting
words.

Example: Secretary Duque is doing a
good job in protecting our health
workers.

### Compound proposition

contains two or
more simple propositions that are put
together using connective words.

Example: Atty. Roque is the best in
cracking jokes and Atty. Panelo is
the most viral legal counsel.

### Component Statements
Words that make up a compound
proposition are called component
statements.

## Types of Compound Proposition

### Conjunction ( ∧ )

E.g. China have Xi Jinping AND Philippines have
Rodrigo Duterte.
Disjunction ( ∨ )

### Inclusive Disjunction (OR)

E.g. I will pay the whole hospital bill OR I will get
a Philhealth subsidy.

### Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)

E.g. I am either covid-19 positive or negative.
Conditional ( → )
E.g. IF the company is not granted a franchise
THEN they will not be allowed to air in free TV.

### Biconditional ( ⟷ )

Conjunction of two conditional statements
where the antecedent/premise and
consequent/conclusion of the first statement
have been switched in the second statement.
E.g. Two sides of a triangle are congruent IF AND
ONLY IF the two angles opposite them are
congruent.


### Negation ( ∼ )

The negation of a given statement is a
statement that is false whenever the given
statement is true, and true whenever the given
statement is false.
E.g. Philippines is winning against the Covid-19
pandemic.
Negation: Philippines is NOT winning against the
Covid-19 pandemic.

## Forms of Conditional Proposition
Suppose P and Q are propositions. The
proposition 𝑃→𝑄 (read as “if P then Q”) is
called an implication. P is called premise or
hypothesis and Q is called conclusion.

### Converse, Inverse, Contrapositive
Suppose P and Q are propositions. Given
the implication 𝑃 → 𝑄(if P then Q).

* Converse is 𝑄 → 𝑃 (if Q then P)
* Inverse is ~𝑃 → ~𝑄 (if not P then not Q)
* Contrapositive ~𝑄 → ~𝑃 (if not Q then not P)

## Negation of Propositions
1. Negation of a Negation:

~(~𝑃) ≡ 𝑃

E.g. Proposition: ABS CBN does not have a violation.
Negation: ABS CBN does have a violation

2. Negation of a Conjunction:

~(𝑃⋀𝑄) ≡ ~𝑃V~Q

E.g. Proposition: Today is a holiday and the next day
is not a holiday.
Negation: Today is not a holiday or the next
day is a holiday.

3. Negation of Disjunction:

~(𝑃V𝑄) ≡ ~𝑃⋀~Q

E.g. Proposition: I will study hard or I will not relax
and chill.
Negation: I will not study hard and I will relax
and chill.

4. Negation of Conditional:

~(𝑃→𝑄) ≡ 𝑃⋀~Q

E.g. Proposition: If you will pass a good
performance task, then you will get a good
grade.
Negation: You will pass a good performance
task and you will not get a good grade.
