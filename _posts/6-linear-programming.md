## Linear Inequalities

Linear inequalities can be
used to model and solve
real-life problems.
For instance, the use of
linear inequalities as
restrictions to the
materials or cost of
production. 

**Linear inequalities** used the inequality symbols to
state relationship between two expressions.

As with an equation, you solve an inequality in the variables x and
y by finding all values of variables for which the inequality is true. Such
values are solutions and are said to satisfy the inequality. The set of all
real numbers that are solutions of an inequality is the solution set of the
inequality.

The set of all points on the plane that represents the solution set is
the graph of the linear inequality. Graphs of linear inequality may be
graph manually, but in this material, you are encouraged to use a
graphical tool like Desmos. 

## Linear Programming

It is a mathematical
technique designed to
help operations managers
plan and make decisions
relative to the trade-offs
necessary to allocate
resources.

### Decision Variables
These are a set of quantities that need to be determined in order to solve the
problem. These variables may represent production levels, transportation levels, etc.
which are under the control of the decision maker(s).

### Objective Function
It is a mathematical expression in linear programming that maximizes or minimizes
some quantity (often profit or cost, but any goal may be used).

### Constraints
These are restrictions that limit the degree to which one can pursue an objective.

### Feasible Region
It is the set of all feasible combinations of decision variables. The area of feasible
solutions must satisfy all conditions specified by the program’s constraints and thus
the region where all constraints overlap. Any point in the region would be a feasible.
Any point outside the shaded area would represent an infeasible solution.


### Graphical Solution

The easiest way to solve a small LP problem is the graphical solution approach. The
graphical procedure may usually use when there are two decision variables. When there are
more than two variables, it is not possible to plot the solution on a two-dimensional graph.
To find the optimal solution to a linear programming problem, we must first identify a
set, or region, of feasible solutions. The first step in doing so is to plot the problem’s constraints
on a graph.

### Corner Point Solution

This technique involves looking at the profit at every corner point of the feasible region.
The mathematical theory behind linear programming states that an optimal solution to any
problem (that is, the values of x, y that yield the maximum profit) will lie at a corner point, or
extreme point, of the feasible region. Hence, it is necessary to find only the values of the
variables at each corner; the maximum profit or optimal solution will lie at one (or more) of
them.
